The new cohort of 16 excited eagar future coders arrive at 10 am to what will be our home for the next 7 weeks: located on the basement floor of one of Camden collective’s pop up shops on camden highstreet, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Turned out the basement location consists of a nice room complete with a chelsea fringe garden!

After introductory talks , from which the most important lesson was:

      The first rule of Code Academy is "Don't be an arse"...as is the second rule and the third


Now feeling as though we were members of an underground coding club we were ready to begin.

First Dan (the course leader) split us into teams of 4, within which we would be working on 7 projects for the next 7 weeks. Then we were treated to a seriously good barbeque coutesy of [1] : http://www.lesgreedycochons.co.uk/ "Les Greedy Cochons"  this unforutunately was not to be a daily occurence!

After lunch it was time to get started! The first project was to build a blog using Github Pages (said blog you are now currently reading!) on which we are going to share our experiences over the next 7 weeks at founders and coders.

####Getting started on building the blog####

We had to get to grips with a range of new software and technical terms: topics were

- Internet & web 
- Development environments 
- Command Line 
- Git and Github 
- Github pages
- Jekyll and markdown 
- Html and Css 
- CSS Frameworks 
- Social media


We used Github to build the Blog. Github is sort of like a social networking site for programmers where code can be shared. It is a web-based hosting service that publishes projects such as blogs. We had to sign up to github online. Then we created a central repository that we could all collaborate on. To add changes to the blog you have to clone the whole repository to your own system: using git clone "url" , in the text editor of your choice (e.g nitrous or using git on your local machine). Then you make changes on your local copy and proceed to "git pull" , "git commit" and "git push" the edits up to the central server.
