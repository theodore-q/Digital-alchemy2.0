Day3
Today we worked on adding widgets to the blog for twitter, google maps and instagram.

Also making modifications to the structure/ template of the blog


We had a guest speaker, Greg Tebbutt ( a previous founder and coders grad ) who told us about his company [Sparrho](http://www.sparrho.com/ "Sparrho") where he currently works and the decisions that got him there. Thanks Greg!
