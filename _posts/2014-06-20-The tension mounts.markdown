Calvin. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Why not? That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. No, not yet. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Let's put him in there. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Doc, she didn't even look at him. That's right, he's gonna be mayor.
