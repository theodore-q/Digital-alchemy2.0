Today Jekyll was used to transform our repository into a blog, essentially providing the blog template.

The rest of the day was spent understanding the jekyll template and then adding Twitter bootstrap (so called because it was built by twitter.)

Bootstrap provides an HTML, css, javascript framework that you can use as a baseis for creatign web sites or web applications. It contains templates of HTML and CSS for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.
